# Ghadeer Club - Islamic Gaming Community Platform

## Mission Statement

**"This app gathers Shia youth for halal gaming under Wilayah to prepare for the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi (ajtf)."**

Ghadeer Club is more than just a gaming platform - it's a spiritual preparation ground where young Shia Muslims unite through age-appropriate gaming while strengthening their faith and building the character needed for the blessed era of our awaited Imam.

## Quranic Foundation

Our platform is anchored in the divine guidance of **Surah Al-Ma'ida 5:55-56**:

> *"Your guardian is only Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe - those who establish prayer and give zakah and bow [in worship]. And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who believe as guardians - then the party of Allah - they will be the predominant."*

This verse establishes the principle of **Wilayah** (divine guardianship) that guides our community's values and mission.
